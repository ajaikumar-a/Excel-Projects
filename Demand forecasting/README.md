## Demand forecasting using Multiple Regression Analysis in Excel

In this project I've used the Excel Data Analysis Toolpak to do the regression analysis and forecasting.

I've explained all the steps I've taken in this Medium article ðŸ‘‰ http://bit.ly/3kJnMDo

### Objective 
To forecast the quantity ordered for a drinks product for 2018 by analyzing the data from 2013 to 2017.

### Steps taken
- Data loading and preparing for the analysis using Power Query.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis to find out the agency which is having the highest orders for the product.
- Using the Data Analysis Toolpak to do the Regression analysis in order to find out the significant variables.
- Comparing the actual demand and the predicted demand by the regression output.
- Calculating Mean Absolute Deviation(MAD) and Mean Absolute Percentage Deviation(MAPD) to get the forecast error of the model in order to understand the accuracy of the model.
- Forecasting the demand for the months of 2018.

### Inferences
- The R square value is 0.870407191 which means that the model is able to comprehend 87% of the changes in the demand data. The model is fairly accurate.
- Also, the variables ***t, Avg temperature along with the months April, May, July, September, October, and December*** are significant for the analysis since these variables are having p-values less than 0.05.
- The forecast error is 3.56% which is very less meaning that the model can fairly predict the demand.
